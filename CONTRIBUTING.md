## Code of Conduct

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code.

## How Can I Contribute?

### Submitting a Bug Report

- Ensure the bug was not already reported by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/Rob-Newman/blzr.bootstrap-select/issues)
- If you find a closed issue that seems like it is the same thing that you're experiencing, open a new issue and include a link to the original issue in the body of your new one
- If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/Rob-Newman/blzr.bootstrap-select/issues/new). Be sure to include a title and clear description, as much relevant information as possible, and a code sample or an executable test case demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring
- If possible, use the relevant bug report templates to create the issue
- Add any relevant labels

### Submitting a Feature Request
- Ensure the feature request has not already been suggested by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/Rob-Newman/blzr.bootstrap-select/issues)
- If it has, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one or check the version if the issue has been closed to see what version the change will be in
- If you're unable to find an open feature request suggesting the change, [open a new one](https://github.com/Rob-Newman/blzr.bootstrap-select/issues/new). Be sure to include a title and clear description, as much relevant information as possible about the expected behavior and outcomes of the new feature 
- If possible, use the relevant feature request templates to create the issue
- Add any relevant labels

### Code Contribution
- Look at the existing code and follow the style
- Always write a clear log message for your commits. One-line messages are fine for small changes, but bigger changes should include a more detailed description
- When only changing documentation, include `[ci skip]` in the commit title

#### Creating a Branch
When creating a branch on your fork that you plan on creating a pull request from, please try to follow the convention below (this allows our auto labeler and release drafter to correctly determine the nature of the change)

- `docs/` - For making changes to documentation or md files
- `bugfix/` - For making bug fix changes
- `feature/` - For making feature or enhancement changes
- `chore/` - For making maintenance changes

#### Pull Requests
- When your change is ready, open a new GitHub pull request, and set the destination branch to be `main`
- Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable
- Ensure the PR has the relevant labels
- After you submit your pull request, verify that all [status checks](https://help.github.com/articles/about-status-checks/) are passing
